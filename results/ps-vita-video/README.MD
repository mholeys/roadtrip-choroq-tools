This is some of the work I have done towards recreating the game, but in Unity on the Vita, as is I have stopped working on this.

But here is some footage of the world on the PS Vita

It runs 100-25 fps depending on the region of the world. No game logic is implemented, I will never share this code/project as it was just for me, and is very empty. The race tracks have a very basic driving ai but it is not optimised and so it runs very slow on the Vita.

The video is not smooth as I used https://github.com/xerpi/vita-udcd-uvc to capture it and the game uses most of the CPU as is.

Please do not contact me to get a copy of the game, as I will not share it, the work can mostly be recreated in a couple of days using the tools in this repo.
